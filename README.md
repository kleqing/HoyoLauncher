# miHoYo Launcher

A custom launcher for Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact written in Python + PySide6 (Python bindings for Qt6).  
This project is actually a GUI skin for my previous project, [mhyscr](https://github.com/shirooo39/mhyscr).

## Download

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/shirooo39/mihoyo_launcher/releases) page

## Working with the source code

There are some requirements you'd need to pay attention to:
1. Python 3.10
2. PySide6

## Disclaimer

- Neither of this project nor me have any relation with miHoYo. I'm just one of their many players.
- This launcher is NOT a replacement for the original launcher!
- The source code is a complete mess.  
  I wish you the best luck reading them because at this point, only God knows how to read it.

## License

I believe I chose the MIT License but, meh... I don't really care that much about licensing.
