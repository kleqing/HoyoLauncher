# miHoYo Launcher >> HoyoLauncher

A custom launcher for Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact and soon Honkai: Star Rail written in Python + PySide6 (Python bindings for Qt6).  
This project is a GUI skin for Shirooo39's previous project, [mhyscr](https://github.com/shirooo39/mhyscr).

## Download

Not included.
Please use the original releases page: [Download](https://github.com/shirooo39/mihoyo_launcher/releases)

## Working with the source code

There are some requirements you'd need to pay attention to:
1. Python 3.10
2. PySide6

## Disclaimer

- Neither of this project nor any of us have any relation with miHoYo. We're just two of their many players.
- This launcher is NOT a replacement for the original launcher!
- The source code is a complete mess. (yeah and what I added is most likely even messier) 
  I wish you the best luck reading them because at this point, only God knows how to read it.

## License

Probably still within MIT License? We don't know much about licensing
