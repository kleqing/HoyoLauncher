# miHoYo Launcher >> HoyoLauncher

A custom launcher for Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact and soon Honkai: Star Rail written in Python + PySide6 (Python bindings for Qt6).  
This project is a GUI skin for Shirooo39's previous project, [mhyscr](https://github.com/shirooo39/mhyscr).

## Working with the source code

There are some requirements you'd need to pay attention to:
1. Python 3.10
2. PySide6

## Disclaimer

- Neither of this project nor any of us have any relation with miHoYo. We're just one of their many players.
- This launcher is NOT a replacement for the original launcher!
- The source code is a complete mess. (yeah and what I added is most likely even messier) 
  I wish you the best luck reading them because at this point, only God knows how to read it.

## License

Probably still within MIT License? I neither know much about licensing

PS. Hey Shirooo! If you're reading this and would like me to take this repo down just hit me up.
